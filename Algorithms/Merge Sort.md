This is a divide and conquer algorithm
	Breaks down problem into multiple sub-problems recursively until they become simple to solve
	Solutions are combined to solve original problem

O(n*log(n)) running time - Optimal for comparison based algorithms


##### General Principle:

1. Split array in half
2. Call merge sort on each half to sort them recursively
3. Merge both sorted halves into one sorted array
