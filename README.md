# Data Structures and Algorithms Notes

Welcome to my GitHub repository for notes on Data Structures and Algorithms. This repository contains detailed notes, explanations, and examples based on the content from multiple YouTube courses/videos and an Udemy course that I've been studying.

## Overview

This repository is a collection of notes and resources that I have compiled while studying data structures and algorithms. It is organized into different sections based on the type of data structure or algorithm covered in the courses. All code examples provided in the notes are written in **Python**.
