#### Data Structure
A data storage format. It is the collection of values and the format they are stored in, the relationships between the values in the collection as well as the operations applied on the data stored in the structure.

#### Why we build data structures instead of just using the ones that come built into our languages?

Each data structure solves a particular problem.

Building custom data structures, instead of solely relying on those built into programming languages, is essential for several reasons:

1. **Specific Requirements**: Built-in data structures may not always meet the specific needs of a particular application. Custom data structures can be tailored to handle unique requirements, optimize performance for specific tasks, or provide additional functionalities that standard structures lack.

2. **Performance Optimization**: Custom data structures can be optimized for specific operations, such as faster insertion, deletion, or search times, which can be crucial in performance-critical applications. They allow developers to implement more efficient algorithms that take advantage of the specific use case.

3. **Memory Management**: Custom data structures can be designed to use memory more efficiently. They can help manage memory usage better than generic built-in structures, especially in resource-constrained environments.

4. **Control and Flexibility**: Custom data structures offer greater control over data management and operations. Developers can define how data is stored, accessed, and manipulated, providing flexibility that built-in structures may not offer.

5. **Advanced Functionality**: Some applications require advanced data manipulation and storage capabilities that go beyond the capabilities of built-in structures. Custom data structures can incorporate these advanced features.

6. **Educational Purposes**: Building custom data structures enhances understanding of fundamental concepts in computer science. It helps developers gain deeper insights into how data structures work and improves problem-solving skills.

7. **Compatibility and Integration**: In some cases, custom data structures are needed to integrate seamlessly with other components or systems, ensuring compatibility and efficient data exchange.

Overall, while built-in data structures are convenient and sufficient for many general-purpose tasks, custom data structures are indispensable for specialized, high-performance, or complex applications, providing the necessary flexibility, efficiency, and control.
