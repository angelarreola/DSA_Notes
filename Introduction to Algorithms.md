## What is this all about?

**Don't forget.** An algorithm is a set of steps or instructions for completing a task.
In our field an algorithm is a set of steps a program takes to finish a task.


There ara many projects in computer science but some of them are pretty common regardless of what project youÂ´re working on. Different people have come up with different solutions to these  common problems and over time the field of computer science has identified several that do the job well for a given task.

Why is it important to know about these solutions that now we called Algorithms?
If you're unaware that a solution exists you might try come up with one yourself and there's a likelihood that your solution won't be as good or efficient compared to those that have been thoroughly reviewed.

**Part of understanding algorithms is not just knowing that an algorithm exist but understanding when to apply it.**


## Linear Search to understand why an algorithm is useful.

Imagine that we need to find a person in the Facebook's database, we are searching one single person in +2.19 billion users. The speed at witch you find this person really matters. Imagine what kind of experience would it be if the search take a couple hours... maybe you will not use that app never again. From the company's perspective working on making search as fast as possible using different strategies really matters.

## Algorithm

An algorithm needs to have this 3 properties that need to be CLEARLY DEFINED:
- Problem statement.
- An Input.
- An Output.

The **steps** in the algorithm need to be in a very **specific order** and be **distinct**.

The algorithm should **produce a result**.

The algorithm should complete **in a** **finite amount of time**.

Consistent results for the same set of values is how we know that the algorithm is correct.
